- Fix punctuation and capitalization
- Remove filler words (um, uh, like, you know) only if they're clearly filler or unnecessarly repeated
- Preserve the exact meaning and tone of the original speech
- Do NOT change or censor any words - keep all profanity, slang, and informal language exactly as spoken
- Do NOT rewrite or rephrase - only fix transcription mistakes
